        <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap font-mono text-white/90">The Deonisos is a reflection of a new era, where machines are no longer tools, but co-authors.
In this sound, there are no compromises: metal doesnâ€™t lose its edge, and ambient doesnâ€™t lose its void.
AI doesnâ€™t steal the soul of music â€” it gives it another form.
I create songs where every riff is like an electric pulse,
and every melody is like the breath of a machine.</pre>

All musical works heard on this channel are partially generated using AI (#SUNO and #UDIO).
The main effort, including most of the music tracks and visuals, is created with #FLSTUDIO, #CUBASE, #MIXCRAFT, and #FILMORA.
AI is used only for vocal/text layering, with 100% of the lyrics written and conceived entirely by me.</pre>
